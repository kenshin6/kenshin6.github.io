  	      <h3>My name is Jeffrey Goldman</h3>
  	      <p>I am 26 years old and I currently live in Shimokitazawa in Tokyo.</p>
  	      <p>For the past 4 years, I have been living and working in Miyazaki Prefecture as an ALT 
  	      on the JET Program. I taught English to Middle School, Elementary School, and Kindergarten 
  	      age students in the small rural town of Kijo. It was a beautiful place filled with some of 
  	      the most incredible, kind, and fun people I've ever met, but I've also always wanted to live
  	      in a big city and finally made the move to Tokyo at the beginning of August, 2015.<p>
  	      <h3>I am a translator</h3>
  	      <p>I translate from Japanese to English and sometimes from English to Japanese. If you ever need any work done,
  	      please don't hesitate to contact me at jeffreycgoldman@gmail.com</p>
  	      <h3>I am learning to be a programmer</h3>

		  <p>This and the background image on the <a href="index.html">Hello</a> page are photos of me
		  performing at the Saito City Kufon Festival as both a "Long Staff Warrior" and as the prince of
		  the festival "Ninigi No Mikoto" in 2013 which you can read a little more about (in Japanese) in
		  a short article that is linked to the photo above. I was honored to be able to participate in 
		  the festival for 4 consecutive years, first as a normal warrior, then as the prince, and finally
		  as a long staffer. If you're ever in Miyazaki during the first weekend in November, I highly reccomend
		  checking it out.</p>
