      	<p>I've always written stories, some good, most bad. And the one thing they have in common
      	is the fact that they haven't been seen by many people. I'd like to change that now. This is probably
      	my favorite one out of the bunch. I hope you enjoy it.<br></p>

      <h4>THE LITTLE MEN WHO LIVED IN MY BEARD</h4>
<h5>By Jeffrey Goldman</h5>

	<p>The last time I saw her alive was on an uncommonly hot day in October. We'd met at the usual place: a little patch of grass facing the river behind Best Buy. Her text simply read, “We need to talk.” The thermostat was pushing 80 and the armpits of my t-shirt were horribly stained.
She had worn a white T-shirt, jean shorts, pink flip flops and a wool scarf with a pattern consisting of four reindeer riding a roller coaster with more corkscrews and loops than I would ever dare to ride. Where she’d bought such a scarf, and why she’d worn it in that blazing heat, I'll never know. Not for lack of asking, mind you, but because she wasn't sure herself.</p>
<p>“Does it matter?” A pile of knotted dandelions stems was growing at her bare feet. She’d walked around in the water and left her flip-flops to dry by the river’s edge.</p>
<p>“No, not really.”</p> 
<p>“Good.”</p>
